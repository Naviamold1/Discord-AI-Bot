> A Discord bot which you lets you chat with a custom AI powered by Ollama and llama3

## Install

Make sure you have installed following apps

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

To set up ollama and llama3:

```sh
ollama serve
ollama run llama3
```

> Run those 2 ollama commands in separate terminal instances AKA DON'T CLOSE the terminal after `ollama serve`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Naviamold1/Discord-AI-Bot
cd Discord-AI-Bot
copy config.example.ini config.ini
```

- Fill out `config.ini` file with Discord `Token`, Bot `Trigger` word and optionally with an AI `Prompt`

### Traditional Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Poetry Install (Optional)

If you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can use that for installation

```sh
poetry shell
poetry install
poetry run python main.py
```

To also install dev dependencies:

```sh
poetry install --with dev
```

## Usage

After the setup simply send a message with a `trigger` word (which you set up in `config.ini` file) at the beginning to start talking with a bot
